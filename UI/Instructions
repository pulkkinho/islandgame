# Ohjelmoinnin tekniikat - IslandGame project

This is a game where the main goal is to save the three pawns
given to the player at the beginning of the game,
where player gets points for each saved pawn.
The game begins with each player having 3 pawns randomly
initialized on the beach of the island.
Once all the pawns have either been saved or died to the dangers lurking
deep in the sea, the game ends and the player with the most points
scored is declared winner. Minimum of two players are required to play and
maximum of six players can play at a time.

Saving a pawn is done by getting the pawn to one of the
coralhexes in the edge of the gameboard. By doing this
the player is granted 1 point. So the maximum poins per player
can be 3 should the player be able to save all of his/her pawns.

Each turn consists three parts. First a player moves his/her pawns. Then the player
sinks one tile of the gameboard. Lastly the player spins a wheel, which points
which animal moves and how much, giving the player ability to move an animal of that type.
The 3rd phase is skipped if there isn't such animal to be found yet.
Then next player starts his/her own turn.

Each turn player has a 3 moves which can be used to move pawns. If players pawn is in water
swimming, moving that specific pawn will cost all 3 moves as swimming is tough. However
there are transport methods that might help the player. Unfortunately there are also
monsters lurking in the deep waters that might be harmful or even fatal to the player.
These transports and monsters are following:

Boat: a boat can fit three pawns. The player with the most pawns in the boat can move the boat.
      In case of a tie, any player with pawns in the boat can move the boat.
      A pawn can be moved to boats on the neighbouring sea tile.

Dolphin: helps a swimmer. A swimmer with the dolphin can be moved three
         moves in a turn. A dolphin can help only one swimmer at a time.

Shark: eats swimmers. The swimmers on the tile are removed from the game.

Kraken: destroys the transports. Passengers are dropped into the sea.

Sea monster: eats swimmers and transports.

Vortex: destroys everything in the neighbouring tiles.
Pawns, animals and boats on the tiles are removed from the game.

Movement is done by first doubleclicking the pawn or actor the player wants to move
and then doubleclicking the target hex where the player want to move to.
